# OODTutor
OOD Tutor is part of a Masters Degree project evaluating the effectivness of online gamification to teach Object-Oriented Design Principles

## Background
Education paradigms have shifted to include online learning and existing research has shown that gamification, the use of gaming concepts, is becoming more prevelant as a way of engaging students as it gives an incentive to learn over traditional classroom based methods.

The aim of this site is therefore to gather data through participants partaking in either a traditional or gamified way of learning where the only thing in common between the two will be the teaching material.
